    <b>Core Concepts Handling Hover, Focus, and Other States</b>

    <p>
      Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally by adding a
      modifier to the beginning of the class name that describes the condition
      you want to target. For example, to apply the bg-sky-700 class on hover,
      use the hover:bg-sky-700 class: Hover over this button to see the
      background color change
    </p>

    <button class="bg-sky-500 hover:bg-sky-700">Save changes</button>

    <p>
      <b>How does this compare to traditional CSS ?</b>

      When writing CSS the traditional way, a single class name would do
      different things based on the current state. Traditionally the same class
      name applies different styles on hover
    </p>

    <div><b>Consider the below example written in pure CSS.</b></div>

    <div>
      <pre>
        .btn-primary { 
           background-color: #0ea5e9; 
        } 
        
        .btn-primary:hover {
          background-color: #0369a1; 
        }
      </pre>
    </div>

    <button class="btn-primary">Save changes</button>

    <div>

        This is what we mean when we say a utility class can be applied
        conditionally â€” by using modifiers you can control exactly how your
        design behaves in different states, without ever leaving your HTML.
