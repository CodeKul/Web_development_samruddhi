<!-- The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a browser-specific convention referring to all the objects
 exposed by the web browser. The BOM allows JavaScript to “interact with” the browser. 
 The object of the window represents a browser window and all its corresponding features. 
 A window object is created automatically by the browser itself. Java Script’s window.screen 
 object contains information about the user’s screen. It can also be written without the window prefix. 


Properties:

screen.width
screen.height
screen.availWidth
screen.availHeight
screen.colorDepth
