<!-- The constructor method is a special method:

It has to have the exact name "constructor"
It is executed automatically when a new object is created
It is used to initialize object properties -->
<!-- If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method. -->

<!-- Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.

Use the keyword class to create a class.

Always add a constructor() method.

Then add any number of methods. -->
