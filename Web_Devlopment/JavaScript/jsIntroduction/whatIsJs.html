    <!-- What is JS? -->
     <p>"JS" commonly refers to JavaScript. JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language 
that is primarily known for its use in web development. It allows developers to add interactivity, 
manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and create dynamic content on websites.</p>

<!--What is dom? -->

<p>The Document Object Model, or DOM, is like a tree structure that represents the elements of a web page. 
    Each element (like paragraphs, images, buttons) is a part of this tree. It allows programmers to 
    interact with and manipulate the content and structure of a webpage using languages like JavaScript.
    
     Imagine your web page as a family tree. The main document is like the root of the tree,
     and each HTML element (like headings, paragraphs, images) is a branch. 
     The DOM is a way for your code to navigate, modify, and add new branches to this tree. 
     This interaction with the tree allows you to change what users see on a webpage dynamically. 
     If you click a button and the webpage updates without reloading, 
     it's likely because JavaScript is using the DOM to make those changes in real-time.</p>

        Click me!
    </button>
    <p id="demo" style="color: rgb(81, 190, 18);">I will change when you click the button.</p>
    
    <script>
        // JavaScript code to interact with the DOM
        var button = document.getElementById("changeTextButton");
        var paragraph = document.getElementById("demo");
    
            button.addEventListener("click", function() {
            paragraph.innerHTML = "Text changed! DOM is awesome!";
            // Change the color of the paragraph text to red when the button is clicked
            paragraph.style.color = "red";
        });
    </script>
    </body>

<!-- What is the application of javascript programming language ? -->
1.Web Development:
Client-Side Scripting:
JavaScript is mainly used to enhance the interactivity and responsiveness of websites by 
enabling client-side scripting. 
It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Frameworks and Libraries: JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, 
such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which are widely used for building modern, 
single-page web applications.

2.Server-Side Development:
With the advent of technologies like Node.js, JavaScript can now be used for 
server-side development as well.
Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript on the server, 
enabling full-stack development with a single language.

3.Mobile App Development:
JavaScript, in combination with frameworks like React Native and Ionic, 
is used for building cross-platform mobile applications. 
This allows developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms, 
such as iOS and Android.


What is node.js ?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code server-side. 
It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, which is the same engine that powers the 
Google Chrome browser. 
Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, 
allowing them to create dynamic web content and build scalable network applications.

Difference between TypeScript and JavaScript
TypeScript is an open-source language to build large-scale web apps, whereas 
JavaScript is a server-side programming language that helps to develop interactive web pages.
