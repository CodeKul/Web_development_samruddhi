<h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>

<p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element.
 It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content.</p>

<div>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, 
    and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer 
    than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.
    This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, 
    and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</div>
