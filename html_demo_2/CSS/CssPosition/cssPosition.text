 In CSS, the position property is used to specify the positioning method for an element. 
 The position property can take several values, each affecting the element's layout and its 
 relationship to the surrounding elements.
 Here are the main values for the position property:

 1.Static :
  This is the default value. Elements with position: static; are positioned according to 
  the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties have no effect.

2.Relative:
A relatively positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. 
The top, right, bottom, and left properties can be used to adjust its position.

3.Absolute:
 An absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor 
 (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). If there is no positioned ancestor, 
  it uses the document body. 
 The top, right, bottom, and left properties can be used to specify the position.
 
4.Fixed :
A fixed positioned element is positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window). 
It stays fixed in place even if the page is scrolled. 
The top, right, bottom, and left properties can be used to specify the position.

5.Sticky :
An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position. 
It acts like relative positioned until it crosses a specified point, 
then it is treated as fixed
