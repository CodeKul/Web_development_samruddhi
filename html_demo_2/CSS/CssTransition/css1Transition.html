    <button>Hover over me</button>

          <li>
            The transition-property property specifies which properties to transition.
            In this case, the special keyword 'all' means to transition any properties
            that change.
          </li> 
          
          <li>The transition-delay property tells us after how many seconds of hovering ; the trnasition should start.</li>

          <li>
            The transition-duration property indicates how long the
            transition will take before reaching the final value. In this case, 3s
            is given, meaning 3 seconds.
          </li>

          <li>
            Note that you did not apply the transition properties in the :hover ruleset; you
            applied them with a selector that targets the element at all times, even though you are
            doing so with the hover rule in mind.
          </li>

          <li>
            You want to transition both while in the hover
            state (transitioning in) and after the hover state (transitioning out). While other values
            are changing, you typically don't want the transition properties themselves to change.
          </li>
