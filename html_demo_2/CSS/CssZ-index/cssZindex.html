 <!-- The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements. 
 It determines the order in which elements appear on the z-axis, with higher values appearing 
 in front of elements with lower values. 
 The z-index property only works on positioned elements
 (elements with a position value other than static). 
 
 Positioned Elements: The z-index property works on elements that have a position value other than static.
  Common values include relative, absolute, and fixed.
