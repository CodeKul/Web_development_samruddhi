   <h3>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h3> 
   <p style="color:blue;">CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. 
    It describes how a webpage should look:
    it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. 
    In short, you can make your website look however you want. 
    CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, 
    including how elements are positioned in the browser. </p>
    <h style="color:darkorange;">CSS provides a basic styling structure, 
    while CSS3 introduces new styling options such as rounded corners, 
    text shadows, and animations</p>
