      In Android and iOS development, a view is the basic building block of UI:
      a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display
      text, images, or respond to user input. Even the smallest visual elements
      of an app, like a line of text or a button, are kinds of views. Some kinds
      of views can contain other views. Itâ€™s views all the way down!
